    <h1>What we do</h1>
     <p>We are dedicated to saving the planet, 3R's at a time! Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Reduce:</h3> Reducing the waste we produce, whether this be plastic, water or food waste. It's all equally important
                  and on our website you can find advice and guidance on how you can implement <i>simple</i> waste reducing
                  practices into your every day life!</li>
        <li><h3>Reuse:</h3> Every little helps when it comes to the 3R's. It's as simple as re-using containers, donating unwanted
                  clothing to charity shops or homeless shelters. Find more information on our 3R's main page!</li>
       <li><h3>Recycle:</h3>The most simple of them all, recycle at any and <b><i>every</i></b> opportunity!</li>
    </ul>
